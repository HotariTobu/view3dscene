# tovrmlx3d

`tovrmlx3d` is a simple command-line program to convert various 3D file formats to X3D and VRML, and to pretty-print X3D and VRML. Note that you can also use `view3dscene` for this task (`view3dscene` has menu items to do it interactively, and command-line options to do it in batch mode). But sometimes using "tovrmlx3d" may be useful as it has lighter requirements (not linked with any GUI libraries, which is useful on a server).

The documentation of command-line options to perform convertion is on https://castle-engine.io/view3dscene.php#section_converting .

# tovrmlx3d

tovrmlx3d is a simple command-line program to convert various 3D file formats to VRML/X3D, and to pretty-print VRML/X3D. Note that you can also view3dscene for this task (view3dscene has menu items to do it interactively, and command-line options to do it in batch mode). But sometimes using "tovrmlx3d" may be useful as it has lighter requirements (not linked with any GUI libraries, which is useful on a server).

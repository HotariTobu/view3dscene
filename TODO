----------------------------------------
Blockers before next release:

- finish, test fully animation kanim handling --- TODOs in view3dscene
  almost all FirstScene should be replaced with something better
- md3 anim

----------------------------------------
Others:

- Things that cannot be animated right now:
  - Octrees, first of all. So collision detection, mouse picking,
    raytracer rendering are all done using octree for the 1st animation
    frame.
  - headlight
  - background

  - Add to docs

  With animations, there's one small caveat right now:
  some features (collision checking, mouse picking,
  ray-tracer --- everything that requires some octree) always use the
  <i>first animation frame</i>, regardless of current animation time.

- allow to change RendererOptimization at runtime
  (instead only using --renderer-optimization at startup),
  this would be nice.

  Save in config file default RendererOptimization.

- CameraRadius powinna byc ustalana na podstawie
  FocalDistance kamery VRML'a,a nie zawsze na podstawie Box3dAvgSize.

  Hmm, some improvement: right now it's adjusted based on
  NavigationInfo.speed. Combine with focalDistance ?
  Look what is the default focalDistance val, I don't remember now.

- Make "Jump to viewpoint" useful also for setup suggested by
  VRML 1.0 specification (and used by some models, including
  VRML 1.0 models generated by my 3DS converter):
  you place miltiple camera nodes under a Switch.
  So GetViewpoint should enter also non-active graph parts
  (but beware to exit only with transformation from
  active graph, i.e.
    Switch {
      Translation { ... }
      Translation { ... }
    }
    PerspetiveCamera { }
  ... and camera must not be translated in this case.

- "wireframe with depth test on" mode

- ui to set up cameraradius when loading scene using menu item "Open".
  Add to docs that --camera-radius only initializes them.

- uzywaj pozostalych pol camera - focalDistance, height

- scene changing on WWWAnchor click
  (some visual indication that mouse is over WWWAnchor -- cursor := crHand
  and some status text "link to ...")

- maybe change NavigatorKind in LoadScene based on whether
  model has some camera node (then nkWalk would be most appropriate)
  or not (then nkExamine).

  This is not so useful now, that I have good control over
  NavigatorKind using NavigationInfo node. Redign ?

- better welcome_scene.wrl
  (and add to last_update.php that we have nice welcome_scene)

- it would be nice to have all --scene-changes available
  as attributes instead ?
    TVRMLFlatSceneGL.Attributes.IgnoreModelNormals (=false)
    TVRMLFlatSceneGL.Attributes.NoSolidObjects (=false)
    TVRMLFlatSceneGL.Attributes.NoConvexFaces (=false)

- allow changing OctreeMaxDepth / MaxLeafItemsCount when program is running.
  1. In menu "Configure scene loading"
  2. make also menu item "Recalculate octree"

- Transform to using Lazarus form, with some OpenGL component wrapping
  GtkGLExt inside.

  This is started in units/3dmodels.gl/examples/view3dscene_mini_by_lazarus/

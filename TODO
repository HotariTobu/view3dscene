Blockers before next release:

----------------------------------------
Others:

- Make "Jump to viewpoint" useful also for setup suggested by
  VRML 1.0 specification (and used by some models, including
  VRML 1.0 models generated by my 3DS converter):
  you place miltiple camera nodes under a Switch.
  So GetViewpoint should enter also non-active graph parts
  (but beware to exit only with transformation from
  active graph, i.e.
    Switch {
      Translation { ... }
      Translation { ... }
    }
    PerspetiveCamera { }
  ... and camera must not be translated in this case.

- better welcome_scene.wrl
  (and add to last_update.php that we have nice welcome_scene)

- it would be nice to have all --scene-changes available
  as attributes instead ?
    TVRMLGLScene.Attributes.IgnoreModelNormals (=false)
    TVRMLGLScene.Attributes.NoSolidObjects (=false)
    TVRMLGLScene.Attributes.NoConvexFaces (=false)

- Transform to using Lazarus form, with some OpenGL component wrapping
  GtkGLExt inside.

  This is started in ../kambi_vrml_game_engine/examples/lazarus/vrml_browser/

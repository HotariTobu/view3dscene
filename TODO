Blockers before next release:

----------------------------------------
Others:

- Things that cannot be animated right now:
  - Octrees, first of all.
    Constructing octree for each scene is too memory (and loading time)
    consuming, so... what ?
    Besides, changing octree means that also player should be automatically
    moved out of it's way, to avoid collision.

    So collision detection, mouse picking,
    raytracer rendering are all done using octree for the 1st animation frame.
    Fixing this means fixing also:
    - SceneOctreeCreate/Free
    - RaytraceToWin call inside MenuCommand
    - SceneTriangle/ShapeStateOctree
  - headlight

  - background animations work, but actually they are too resource intensive
    (see kambi_vrml_test_suite/kanim/ background test)

  - saving to VRML also only saves 1st frame for now

  - RemoveSelectedGeometry/Face work on 1st frame (so I require
    that you can use them only when it's the only frame) for now

- Make "Jump to viewpoint" useful also for setup suggested by
  VRML 1.0 specification (and used by some models, including
  VRML 1.0 models generated by my 3DS converter):
  you place miltiple camera nodes under a Switch.
  So GetViewpoint should enter also non-active graph parts
  (but beware to exit only with transformation from
  active graph, i.e.
    Switch {
      Translation { ... }
      Translation { ... }
    }
    PerspetiveCamera { }
  ... and camera must not be translated in this case.

- better welcome_scene.wrl
  (and add to last_update.php that we have nice welcome_scene)

- it would be nice to have all --scene-changes available
  as attributes instead ?
    TVRMLGLScene.Attributes.IgnoreModelNormals (=false)
    TVRMLGLScene.Attributes.NoSolidObjects (=false)
    TVRMLGLScene.Attributes.NoConvexFaces (=false)

- Transform to using Lazarus form, with some OpenGL component wrapping
  GtkGLExt inside.

  This is started in ../kambi_vrml_game_engine/examples/vrml/lazarus_vrml_browser/

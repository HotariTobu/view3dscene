Blockers before next release:

----------------------------------------
Others:

- better welcome_scene.wrl
  (and add to last_update.php that we have nice welcome_scene)

- it would be nice to have all --scene-changes available
  as attributes instead ?
    TVRMLGLScene.Attributes.IgnoreModelNormals (=false)
    TVRMLGLScene.Attributes.NoSolidObjects (=false)
    TVRMLGLScene.Attributes.NoConvexFaces (=false)

- Transform to using Lazarus form, with some OpenGL component wrapping
  GtkGLExt inside.

  This is started in ../castle_game_engine/examples/lazarus/vrml_browser/

  Depends on making Lazarus OpenGL component good, which isn't the case
  yet --- it stutters (e.g. when mouse look), it doesn't have all the
  stencil / etc. buffer configurations yet.

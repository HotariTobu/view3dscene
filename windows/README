(Don't hold me too much for any info in this file (and please report mistakes),
I'm not a Windows programmer, I just wanted to quickly reuse my beatiful
SVG icon for ugly Windows exe.)

- The automatic export by Inkscape to 32x32 size in view3dscene.png was
  a starting point. But at 32x32, you really have to fix details manually.
  Also Windows (at least Win 2000 Prof) cannot handle 8bit alpha well (actually,
  it's not handled at all, it seems). So the view3dscene.png version was reworked
  in GIMP a bit to make it look good.

- Then convert from view3dscene.png -> view3dscene.ico.
  I used GIMP (choosing 8bpp, 1bit alpha, 256 palette --- like said, Windows
  doesn't seem to handle 8bit alpha channel, it's just ignored.)

- After this `make' will do view3dscene.res, which will be automatically included
  in view3dscene.exe when recompiled.

"make install" (in parent dir, -C ..) does basic install of this for
current user.

See http://library.gnome.org/devel/integration-guide/stable/desktop-files.html.en
for basic GNOME integration instructions.

Desktop file
- Should be copied to /usr/share/applications or ~/.local/share/applications
  (for GNOME <= 2.10 (<= 2.8 on Fedora) this should be
  ~/.gnome2/vfolders/applications).
- See http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html
  for a list of allowed Category values.

Icon file
- Should be copied under /usr/share/icons/,
  most standard is /usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/.
  Local user has this in ~/.local/share/icons/
  and ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/
- "48x48" is just indicated as most standard, and smaller versions will
  be generated from it. For SVG icons, I think (but didn't actually
  read this anywhere) they should go to "scalable" subdir.
- Update: although on my Debian "scalable" subdir is indeed standard,
  it looks like desktop icon remains for some reason stupidly small
  (even though it's recorded in SVG file that resolution is 48x48).
  Yes, this happens to other programs with only scalable icons too,
  like eog. It doesn't happen e.g. to evolution --- because evolution
  just adds 48x48 icon as PNG file, in addition to SVG in scalable.

Mime file
- Should be copied to /usr/share/mime/packages/,
  local user location is ~/.local/share/mime/packages/.
- After copying you should run
    update-mime-database /usr/share/mime
  or equivalent for local user location.
- Note that our mime XML file describes "model/x3d+binary", but it's
  not yet listed in our desktop file --- because we do not handle x3db yet.

You may want to run
  killall gnome-panel
  killall nautilus
to refresh icons and mime types everywhere without relogging to GNOME.
(If anyone knows a cleaner to do this, please let me know.) Without these
kills, only the menu entry is actomatically updated. I.e. changes to *.desktop
files dir are picked up automatically, but icon and mime files not (it seems).
